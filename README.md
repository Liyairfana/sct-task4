# 🤚 Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify hand gestures from image data. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to design, train, and evaluate a deep learning model capable of recognizing various hand gestures.

## 📌 Objective
To develop a gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify hand gestures from a set of images.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Image resizing and normalization  
   - Data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`

2. **Model Building**  
   - CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers  
   - Compilation with `adam` optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` loss

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained over multiple epochs with validation  
   - Accuracy and loss plotted using Matplotlib  
   - Confusion matrix and classification report generated

## 📊 Results
- Achieved good accuracy on test data  
- Model can be extended for real-time gesture recognition with webcam input

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate with a real-time camera input for gesture control  
- Expand dataset for better generalization
